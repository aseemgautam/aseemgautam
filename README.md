### Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px" height="20px">

I am creative, hands-on developer who is passionate about software engineering, building products that are easy to use, delight users and solve real world problems. Though not a designer by profession, I have keen interest in usability & user experience (application/software design).

Stared programming & graphic design in high school (1997).

Professionally, I have a diverse work experience (~15 years) from building products like forex trading systems, bitcoin miner to working as CTO for a funded startup.

Recently I worked as a technical architect (& lead) of a multi million $ mobile app build in React Native for STC (Saudi Telecom Company). At present I am helping a few international companies build their engineering teams.
